This collection of files and folders represents some (but not all) of my ongoing ruby learning journey. 

After a few months of work, running everything locally, I realized that I will be more comfortable with Git if I use it all the time, so I will now be using it regularly.

Already, in setting up this repo, removing the old stuff and adding the new stuff (and moving it from the many spots it lives in my computer) I am feeling a little more comfortable with Git. 

Onward!
